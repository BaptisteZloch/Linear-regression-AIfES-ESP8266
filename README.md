# Linear-regression-AIfES-ESP8266
This repository is dedicated to a project of running a linear regression on ESP8266 NodeMCU using the AIfEs for Arduino library.
The mathematical expression used to define the regression in 2x+1. The model has been trained on 5 samples during 600 epochs for a inal accuracy around 46%.
